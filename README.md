### Decarbonizing Single Family Homes and Neighborhoods in NYC

The goal of this project is to develop a Local Area Energy Planning (LAEP) playbook for sustainable energy transition. We are currently focusing on single-family homes and neighborhoods in New York City, motivated by the city's ambitious mandate to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 (CLCPA).

LAEP is a data-driven and whole energy system approach to developing a tool that identifies the most effective local area energy transition path. To create the LAEP playbook, we have been working on several components, including understanding the current state of the energy system that powers our homes, developing target questions to improve the energy system to meet net-zero demands, collecting and cataloging data to maintain data quality standards, and creating a tool for bringing disconnected components together to create an urban planning resource.

Our project examines the relationship between building stock, infrastructure networks, energy usage, community needs, and regulations. We're analyzing building stock using MapPLUTO data and identifying single-family neighborhoods. We've created a new dataset that provides hyperlocal spatiotemporal data on infrastructure networks, such as the location, length, and age of natural gas, electric, and water pipelines. Lowering residential emissions requires phasing out natural gas for heating. In spite of this, 30% of current city street work involves replacing aging gas infrastructure. Laying new gas pipelines is expensive, locks in methane emissions, and is cost-prohibitive for electrifying neighborhoods, making it an equity and cost issue that needs urgent attention.

To understand energy usage at the building level, we used modeled Energy Data from National Renewable Energy Laboratory ResStock, which provides a time series of building energy usage for different energy efficiency scenarios. We created a matching algorithm to use building characteristics from MapPluto to end-use load profiles from ResStock and now have a virtual energy meter for each single-family building.

Our next steps include designing an LAEP configuration language that integrates all components and enables simulations of various energy transition scenarios to achieve net-zero goals. Overall, we believe by focusing on building stock, infrastructure network, energy usage, community needs, and regulatory conditions, LAEP can provide actionable steps to reduce emissions and achieve net-zero targets.
